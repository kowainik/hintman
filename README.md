## Motivation

If you're an open source maintainer, reviewing incoming pull requests from
various contributors can be tedious. You want to ensure excellent code quality.
But you don't want to spend your time on things that can be automated. Hintman
helps you with that! It submits inline suggestions to all open pull requests so
you can apply them immediately.
