More precise explanation of the logic within function:

First, we obtain the last symbol of file. If file is empty, the execution stops and 'Nothing' is returned.
Then we check if the last symbol is '\n'. If it is, we return 'Nothing'.
Otherwise, we take the last line of file and return it.

An important note here is that result of lines will trim a '\n' symbol from the last line, so
we can't just check the last symbol of line, we have to check last symbol of raw content).
